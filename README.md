# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of PyBer Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to analyze how the provided ride-share data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers.  This analysis includes the following deliverables:

1.  Ride-sharing summary DataFrame by city type
2.  Multi-line chart of total fares for each city type
3.  Business Recommendations

## Results
Using the provided ride-sharing data a [summary dataframe](Resources/summary_dataframe.png) was created to provide visibiltiy to the different city types by total rides, total drivers, total fares, and average fare per ride/driver.  This information is also summarized graphically in the following [PyBer Fare Summary](PyBer_fare_summary.png)

The following can be inferred based upon the summary graphics produced:
-Rural cities have the lowest ride/driver count as well as the lowest total fares due to the smaller population size of rural cities.  
-The highest Avg. Fare per ride/driver are those in rural cities.  This may be due to the fact that rural cities are less dense (requiring a greater distance to travel between pick-up and drop-off).

## Summary
In summary, this analysis supports the following business recommendations:
1.  Increase the number of drivers currently supporting rural cities as the Avg. Fare per ride is  1.4x that of urban areas
2.  Decrease the number of drivers located in urban cities as there are more drivers than rides
3.  Hold the current business model for Suburban cities
